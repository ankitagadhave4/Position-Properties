                <p>Shivaji (born February 19, 1630, or April 1627, Shivner, Poona [now Pune], India—died April 3, 1680, Raigad) was an individual who opposed the Mughal dynasty and founded the Maratha kingdom in 17th-century India.</p>
                <p>His kingdom’s security was based on religious toleration and on the functional integration of Brahmans, Marathas, and Prabhus.</p>
                <p>Shivaji was descended from a line of prominent nobles. India at the time of his birth, in 1630, was under Muslim rule: the Mughals in the north and the Muslim sultans of Bijapur and Golconda in the south. </p>
